# satelite

A desktop sidebar/dashboard concept inspired by [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky), but much easier to configure, extend and with much more power. Built on top of [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) in javascript.

### Features
- cross-platform (in theory, as it's build with electron)
- plugins - it will provide a set of default plugins (clock, weather, gmail-checker, shortcuts panel, etc.) and allow to easily create custom ones (why? because it's javascript!)
- it is node-based - so you have access to all the node-power to create custom plugins/services
- it has access to the host OS, so if you can run something in terminal - you can do here 
- themes/skins - it will allow for an infinite customisation (with simple html & css)
